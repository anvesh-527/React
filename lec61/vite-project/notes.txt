Components --> Kind of functions(Just to understand)

We can create class and function based components 

As React got updated --> now we are using only function based components

Component --> A function that gives us html jaisa code to render

For giving a class name to an html element we have to use className because class is reserved keyword in React

Whenever we are creating a component in React do not create Multiple tage at same level (in return statement)

props - Used to pass the data between components
