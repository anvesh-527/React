Intro to files/Folders

1. public --> Contains all the static files such as fevicon,image --> Files which doesn't need to build 
2. src --> Contains the main components to be written 
    assets(In src) --> fonts, extra css files etc 
--> Initially the index.html gets executed which contains the App Component 
--> The App Component refers to the App.

Flow of execution 
index.html --> We can style using index.css --> Div with an id Root --> Linked with Main.jsx 
Main.jsx --> Telling us to render the App component 
App Component contains the code to be rendered

Instead of Main.jsx we might get Index.jsx --> no need to worry 

Jsx --> (html+js)
The code we written converts into jsx then into React Code then into html 
This html is rendered by the browser


Whenever we create a component use rafce + tab to get the boiler plate code
