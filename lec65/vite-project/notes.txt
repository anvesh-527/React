State lifting in React Js

In Props, the data is passed from parent to the child
But in some cases we need to pass the data from child to parent.
Example :- When ChildA and childB has to use same state 
This is where the State Lifting comes into picture 

Instead of creating the state in the child create the state in parent.

The parent should take care of creating,managing,changing the state 
We can sync all the child components 

All are in sync.

Example:- Used in search suggestion as shown in google.
